## University Assignments 
This repository contains some of the exercises and projects which I have completed during my college.

# Concurrent workshop - Java Concurrent Programming assignment 
Project aimed to create some kind of facility to manage workers and provide safe access to
their places of work. In this program many of the concurrent synchronizing primitives were
used in order to provide sync between workers (which were represented as threads).

# Executor - C Concurrent Programming assignment
Program's purpose was to execute instructions line by line and launch other programs in order
to control theirs outputs. Pthread library was strongly used in this project and some of the
operating system's specific functions (like fork()).

# Matrices - Java Object-Oriented Programming assignment
Library to provide basics operation like matrix multiplication or addition. Object oriented
programming was used to represent some special classes of matrices in order to provide more
efficient operations by exploiting polymorphism.

# Images - C++ Programming Course assignment
Project is a library to perform some simple operations on functional images. C++ functional
programming was strongly used, even some of features were added - like function composition.
C++ templates were providing this project with flexibility in definition of color.
